## abstract

We describe here a novel concept of a gantry for hadron therapy, based on the use of a toroidal field configuration. The main features of this concept are that the gantry is not rotating, and is operated in steady-state We propose that is built based on superconducting magnets, reaching field levels not achievable using normal conducting iron-dominated magnets. The simplification resulting from the specific magnetic configuration, and the scale reduction that can be achieved using high-field superconducting magnets, bear a definite potential for significant reduction of dimensions and mass. In this paper we introduce the concept of the toroidal gantry, discussing the features of beam transport in a toroidal field. We then provide general considerations on the design of the coil, and analytical scaling of relevant indicators such as forces and stored energy. Finally, we give an example of practical layouts for a proton gantry that can be used as a benchmark for comparison with other designs.

我们在此基于环形场结构的使用来描述用于强子治疗的龙门架的新概念。此概念的主要特征是，机架不旋转，并且在稳态下运行。我们建议该机架基于超导磁体构建，达到使用普通导电铁为主的磁体无法达到的磁场水平。由特定的磁性结构引起的简化以及使用高磁场超导磁体可以实现的尺寸减小具有明显减小尺寸和质量的潜力。在本文中，我们介绍了环形龙门架的概念，并讨论了环形场中光束传输的特征。然后，我们对线圈的设计以及相关指标（例如力和存储的能量）的分析缩放提供一般考虑。最后，我们给出了一个质子龙门架实用布局的示例，可以用作与其他设计进行比较的基准。
