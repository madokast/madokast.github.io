### Abstract
—Recent studies have shown that strong, alternating focusing magnets can be used to greatly increase the momentum acceptance of hadron therapy gantries. With the high gradients achievable with superconducting magnets a level of momentum acceptance can be reached which may have significant implications to medical gantries and to the introduction of superconducting technology in this area. The design of such a superconducting magnet system for a proton therapy gantry will be presented. The Canted-Cosine-Theta concept is extended to a curved magnet system generating the desired bending and alternating focusing fields for the achromatic optics. Magnetic, structural, and thermal analysis of this design is presented along with preliminary efforts towards fabrication and assembly of the curved magnet.

Index Terms—Accelerator magnets, superconducting gantry magnets, proton therapy, ion beam therapy, canted-cosine-theta.
